  #========================================================================
  # fileName is namer of cwa file to read
  # start can be timestamp "year-month-day hr:min:sec" or non-negative integer
  #       which is page number. Page size is 300 of measurements with specified
  #       frequency.
  # end can be timestamp "year-month-day hr:min:sec" or non-negative integer
  #       which is page number. End must be not less than start. If end is
  #       less or equal to start then there is no data read. Page size is 300 of
  #       measurements with specified frequency.
  # progressBar is trigger to switch on/off the text progress bar. If progressBar
  #       is TRUE then the function displays the progress bar but it works
  #       slightly slower
  # desiredtz is desired time zone
  # Returned structure contains all data from start inclusive till end exclusive.
  # If start == end then data section of final structure is empty.
  # Page size is 300 observations per page
  #
  # Structure of output is list with following elements
  #   header is list of header information
  #       uniqueSerialCode is unque serial code of used device
  #       frequency is measurement frequency. All data will be resampled
  #           for this frequency.
  #       start is timestamp in numeric form. To get text representation
  #           it is enough to use
  #               as.POSIXct(start, origin = "1970-01-01", tz=desiredtz)
  #       device is "Axivity"
  #       firmwareVersion is version of firmware
  #       blocks is number of datablocks with 80 or 120 raw observations in each.
  #           Unfortunately frequency of measurement is varied in this device.
  #   data is data.frame with following columns
  #       time is timestamp in numeric form. To get text representation
  #           it is enough to use
  #               as.POSIXct(start, origin = "1970-01-01", tz=desiredtz)
