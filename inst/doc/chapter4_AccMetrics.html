<h1 class="title toc-ignore">4. From Raw Data to Acceleration
Metrics</h1>



<div id="why-do-we-need-to-extract-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Why do we need to extract metrics</h2>
<p>Wearable accelerometers are widely used in health research to study
physical activity, sleep, and other behaviours. Most modern
accelerometers are able to collect and store at least 30 values per
second expressed in units of gravitational acceleration (<em>g</em>).
Once the data is collected, health researchers typically want to derive
from this data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Activity types and body postures like sleep, walking, running,
sitting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy expenditure or a measure of body acceleration that can act
as a good proxy for energy expenditure.</p></li>
<li><p>Various other outcomes, i.e. gait, balance, circadian rhythm
analysis, and falls.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A critical step in going from the high-resolution data to the
classification of activity types or energy expenditure is to calculate
metrics, also known as signal features. A metric allows us to extract
information from the signal. One approach is to calculate statistical
properties of the data like the mean, standard deviation, entropy, and
skewness. Another approach is to design the data metrics with domain
knowledge about the process that generated the data. I personally prefer
the domain knowledge-driven approach because it allows us to narrow down
the search space for a successful metric and it aims at a good
understanding of what we calculate.</p>
<p>In the domain-driven approach, a distinction is made between three
acceleration signal components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Acceleration related to gravitational acceleration and by that
the orientation of the accelerometer relative to gravity.</p></li>
<li><p>Accelerations and decelerations related to movement and by that a
proxy of muscle contractions and the energy expenditure needed for
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal noise.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finding a metric that can separate these three components will
provide informative value in relation to posture and magnitude of
acceleration as a proxy for muscle contraction related to body movement
and associated energy expenditure.</p>
</div>
<div id="metric-aggregation-per-epoch" class="section level2">
<h2>Metric aggregation per epoch</h2>
<p>Although most metrics are calculated per time point, which reflect a
tiny fraction of a second, GGIR then continues to aggregate these values
per epoch (e.g., 5 seconds) for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aggregation per epoch reduces value dependency on sampling
frequency, which varies between studies, and by that eases comparisons
across studies.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence on the value of accelerometer data is based on epoch
level aggregates, because reference values like oxygen consumption or
sleep cannot reliably be derived at sub-second resolution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The epoch length is kept constant within GGIR to allow for consistent
interpretation. The epoch length is set with the first value of
parameter <code>windowsizes</code> and used throughout all steps of
GGIR, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In GGIR part 2, the time spent in MVPA variables (as discussed in
a later chapter) is done with multiple epoch lengths, one for each
output variable. However, per output variable, the epoch length is held
constant throughout the recording. GGIR never mixes epoch
lengths.</p></li>
<li><p>In GGIR part 5, the user has the option to aggregate all epochs
to 1 minute length with parameter <code>part5_agg2_60seconds</code>. For
example, when using 5 second epochs in parts 1, 2, 3, and 4, it can be
informative to run part 5 with 1 minute epoch length.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="acceleration-metrics-available-in-ggir" class="section level2">
<h2>Acceleration metrics available in GGIR</h2>
<p>Below you will find a list of all metrics that GGIR can apply.
Multiple metrics can be derived in the same GGIR run. All acceleration
metrics are derived in GGIR function <a href="https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/R/g.applymetrics.R"><code>g.applymetrics</code></a>.
Only for Neishabouri counts GGIR relies on the R package
<code>actifelifecounts</code>. Please see the code in the respective
package documentation for information on the exact calculations. To use
the metrics, add the parameters to your GGIR call, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>GGIR(do.enmo = TRUE, do.mad = TRUE, do.bfen = TRUE, …)</code></pre>

<div id="approach-to-removing-the-gravitational-signal-component" class="section level3">
<h3>Approach to removing the gravitational signal component</h3>
<p>The table above indicates the approach used to separate the
gravitation component from the acceleration signal. There are two
approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnitude, where the metric makes an assumption about the
magnitude of the gravitational acceleration component.</p></li>
<li><p>Frequency, where the metric makes an assumption about the
frequency content of the gravitational acceleration component.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both assumptions are known to not hold true under all conditions,
which is why no acceleration metric is perfect.</p>
</div>
<div id="handling-high-frequency-components-in-the-signal" class="section level3">
<h3>Handling high frequency components in the signal</h3>
<p>Some argue that high frequency components in the signal should be
treated as noise and be removed. However, they more likely represent the
harmonics of low frequency movements and are thus part of the
description of movement. For a more elaborate reflection on this, please
see <a href="https://www.accelting.com/updates/high-frequencies-in-an-acceleration-signal/">this
blog post</a>.</p>
<p>All metrics that have the letter LF or BF in their name attempt to
suppress the high frequency content of the signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-ggir-uses-enmo-as-a-default." class="section level3">
<h3>Why GGIR uses ENMO as a default.</h3>
<p>Only one metric can be the default. Acceleration metric ENMO
(Euclidean Norm Minus One with negative values rounded to zero) has been
the default metric since GGIR was created. In 2013, we investigated
different ways of summarising the raw acceleration data (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061691">van Hees et al. PLoS
ONE 2013</a>). In short, different metrics exist and there is very
little literature to support the superiority of any metric at the time.
As long as different studies use different metrics, their findings will
not be comparable. Therefore, the choice for metric ENMO has been
partially pragmatic. GGIR uses ENMO as default because:</p>
<p>1. ENMO has demonstrated value in describing variance in daily energy
expenditure, is correlated with questionnaire data, and able to describe
patterns in physical activity.</p>
<p>2. ENMO is easy to describe mathematically and by that improves
reproducibility across studies and software tools.</p>
<p>3. ENMO attempts to quantify the acceleration in universal units and
does not collapse the signal to an abstract scale.</p>
<p>4. The 2013 paper showed that when ENMO is used in combination with
auto-calibration, it has similar validity to filter-based metrics like
HFEN and BFEN, which are conceptually similar to metrics proposed later
such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0068">MIMSunit</a>,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-015-0010-0">MAD</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160644">AI0</a>.</p>
<p>5. Studies who have criticised ENMO consistently failed to apply
auto-calibration, or attempted to apply auto-calibration in a lab
setting, ignoring the fact that auto-calibration is not designed for
short lab settings. It needs free-living data to work properly. Further,
studies are often not clear about how the problematic zero imputation
during the idle sleep mode in ActiGraph devices is dealt with.</p>
</div>
<div id="notes-on-implementation-of-zero-crossing-counts" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes on implementation of zero crossing counts</h3>
<p>The implementation of the zero-crossing count in GGIR is an attempt
to imitate the zero-crossed counts previously described by Sadeh, Cole,
Kripke and colleagues in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, it cannot be
guaranteed to be an exact copy of the original approach, which used the
AMA-32 Motionlogger Actigraph by Ambulatory-monitoring Inc. (“AMI”).</p>
<p>No complete publicly accessible description of that approach
exists.</p>
<div id="missing-information" class="section level4">
<h4>Missing information</h4>
<p>The missing information about the calculation are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sadeh specified that calculations were done based on data from the
Y-axis but the direction of the Y-axis was not clarified. Therefore, it
is unclear whether the Y-axis at that time corresponded to the Y-axis of
modern sensors.</li>
<li>A frequency filter was used, but properties of the filter are
missing.</li>
<li>Sensitivity of the sensor: We are now guessing that the Motionlogger
had a sensitivity of 0.01 <em>g</em> but without direct proof.</li>
<li>Relationship between piezo-electric acceleration signal used at that
time and modern piezo-capacitive acceleration signals.</li>
</ol>
<p>From personal correspondence with AMI, we learnt that the technique
has been kept proprietary and has never been shared with or sold to
other actigraphy manufacturers (time of correspondence October 2021).
Based on the correspondence with AMI, we can conclude that even
Actiwatch, ActiGraph, and other manufacturers, who have facilitated the
use of 1990s sleep classification algorithms, cannot guarantee exact
replication of the original studies.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-guess-on-the-missing-information" class="section level4">
<h4>Our guess on the missing information</h4>
<p>Following the above challenges, the implementation of the
zero-crossing count in GGIR is based on an educated guess where we used
all information we could find in the literature and product
documentation. In relation to the missing information listed above:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We allow you to specify which axis you want to use with parameter
<code>Sadeh_axis</code> but choose as default the second axis.</li>
<li>We use a 0.25 - 3 Hertz band-pass filter with order 2, which you can
modify with parameters <code>zc.lb</code>, <code>zc.hb</code>, and
<code>zc.order</code>.</li>
<li>We use a 0.01 <em>g</em> stop band, which you can change with
parameter <code>zc.sb</code>.</li>
<li>We assume that the band-passed signal is comparable in the absence
of evidence on the contrary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our own evaluation, the zero-crossing count value range looks
plausible when compared to the value range in the original
publications.</p>
<p>As a note to ActiGraph users: If you decide to compare GGIR
Cole-Kripke estimates with ActiLife’s Cole Kripke estimates, be aware
that ActiLife may have adopted a different Cole-Kripke algorithm as the
original publication presented four algorithms. This is a potential
source of variation. Further, ActiLife may have used different educated
guesses about how Motionlogger counts are calculated.</p>

<div id="embedding-your-own-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Embedding your own metrics</h2>
<p>Some GGIR users may like to use metrics not covered by GGIR. To
facilitate this, we allow for external function embedding as discussed
in the vignette <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/vignettes/ExternalFunction.html">Embedding
external functions in GGIR</a>. In fact, this allows you to include
entire algorithms such as the <a href="https://github.com/ShimmerEngineering/Verisense-Toolbox/tree/master/Verisense_step_algorithm">step
detection</a> or a new sleep classification algorithm that you would
like to test inside GGIR.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-output" class="section level2">
<h2>Related output</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>GGIR part 2</strong>, output is derived for each
acceleration metric derived in GGIR part 1 except for metrics anglex,
angley, and anglez.</li>
<li>In <strong>GGIR part 4</strong>, output is derived from only the
metrics used for the sleep detection, typically angle or count
(Neishabouri counts or zero-crossing count).</li>
<li>In <strong>GGIR part 5</strong>, output is derived for only the
single metric specified with parameter <code>acc.metric</code>. The
reason for this constraint is that part 5 produces many variables and
creating all of them for multiple metrics would be computationally
expensive and would substantially increase the complexity of the
underlying code.</li>
</ul>

<div id="references" class="section level2">
