  g.report.part5(metadatadir = c(), f0 = c(), f1 = c(), loglocation = c(),
                          params_cleaning = NULL,
                          week_weekend_aggregate.part5 = FALSE,
                          LUX_day_segments = c(),

}
\arguments{
  \item{metadatadir}{
    Directory that holds a folder 'meta' and inside this a folder 'basic'
    which contains the milestone data produced by \link{g.part1}. The folderstructure
    is normally created by \link{g.part1} and \link{GGIR} will recognise what
    the value of metadatadir is.
  }
  \item{f0}{
    File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the filenames sorted
    in alphabetical order
  }
  \item{f1}{
    File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available, i.e., f1 = 0)
  }
  \item{loglocation}{

   See details in \link{GGIR}.
  }
  \item{week_weekend_aggregate.part5}{
   Boolean to indicate whether week and weekend-days aggregates
   should be stored. This is turned off by default as it generates a 
   large number of extra columns in the output report.
  }
  \item{LUX_day_segments}{
   see \link{g.part5}
  }
  \item{verbose}{
    See details in \link{GGIR}.

  }

  in csv format
