GGIR documentation is openly available for users in several places:

-   **This [dedicated website](https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/)**
    containing instructions to install, get started, and specific
    documentation on the GGIR pipeline and functionalities.

-   **Vignettes available on
    [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/index.html)**,
    containing an overview of GGIR and dedicated vignettes for some
    specific functionalities.

-   **The [GGIR configuration parameters
    vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/vignettes/GGIRParameters.html)**
    explains each of the parameters that can be used in GGIR and how to
    use them.

-   The **GGIR function documentation**, to which you can get access to
    directly from R:

``` r
library(GGIR)
?GGIR
```

## Question and problems

For general questions and issues please report in the [GGIR google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR)[.]{.underline}

However, if you are familiar with GitHub you are also welcome to report
your issue via the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues).

Note that support in these places is based on voluntary efforts and we
encourage you to try and help other users with questions.

Questions are valuable as they help us understand the challenges you run
into and they occasionally help us to identify a bug in the code.
However, to make this practical it would be great if you doNOT send us
your questions via personal messages. Posting on public platforms
enables others to learn from the conversations, it reduces the chance
that we have to answer the same question multiple times, it increases
the chance that someone else can answer your question when we are not
available, and it gives recognition for the voluntary time people put
into answering questions.
